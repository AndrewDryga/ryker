# infra - emisar on Google Cloud

This directory is the production Terraform configuration for the emisar control
plane. HCP Terraform workspace `Dryga/emisar` owns state and applies. GitHub CD
uploads reviewed configurations and creates saved plans; it never applies them.

See [the deployment runbook](../.agent/kb/runbooks/deployment.md) for the public delivery,
rollout, and rollback contract.

## Delivery

Every main-branch delivery reuses the exact CI workflow that tested the commit.
Every successful `main` commit receives a tested portal image published to GHCR
by immutable digest. CD then:

1. Verifies the commit is still current `main`.
2. Uploads `infra/` as a provisional HCP Terraform configuration.
3. Creates a saved plan with that commit's tested image digest.
4. Stops and links the complete plan in the GitHub job summary.

Review every resource action and the run's commit before selecting **Confirm &
Apply** in HCP Terraform. The image revision must match the run's commit; CD does
not fall back to the older applied image after a failed plan. Workspace
auto-apply must remain disabled. A replaced or stale saved plan is discarded
instead of applying against changed state.

Normal image rollouts may create one replacement VM per zone while retaining
every old serving VM. Each replacement's `/healthz` remains false until the
release has reached PostgreSQL once; only then can the MIG remove an old VM. The
load balancer independently requires `/readyz` continuously. Old and new application
versions overlap briefly; before 1.0 a schema change ships in one release, with
no expand/contract phases. Rollback is
another reviewed plan that sets `container_image` to a previously published
IAM-capable digest. Images from before the IAM database runtime are not rollback
candidates. The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy is a separately pinned infrastructure
container. The private admin runner is independently pinned in cloud-init and
continues to invoke the colocated portal release through its stable RPC boundary.

Readiness-contract replacements build a complete successor backend, wait for
every expected VM to pass `/readyz`, switch the URL map, and retain the previous
backend for five minutes while that change reaches every edge proxy. `getHealth`
alone is not sufficient: Google edge proxies can lag the control-plane URL-map
result. The regional MIG keeps the stable name `emisar`; changing its zone set
requires a separately reviewed staged migration, not an ordinary one-plan
replacement.

## Runtime shape

Cloud-init fetches exact Secret Manager versions, assigns the
instance's internal IP to `NODE_IP`, runs Ecto migrations under their advisory
lock, and starts the already-cached immutable container digest. A separately
pinned loopback Cloud SQL Auth Proxy container obtains short-lived
database credentials from the VM identity; the application assumes the non-login
`emisar_owner` role. Cloud-init installs the pinned runner release directly on
the COS host and writes the private packs from the reviewed Terraform module;
the portal container contains only the application release. GCP pack actions
invoke a digest-pinned Google Cloud CLI container with no host mounts and use
the VM identity through the metadata server. The HCP Terraform token is fetched
from one exact Secret Manager version into the runner process and reaches pack
actions only through the `TFE_TOKEN` inherit allowlist; neither credential enters
instance metadata or command arguments.
`Emisar.Cluster.GCE` discovers running peers by
the `cluster_name` label through the Compute API. Erlang distribution is limited
to tagged application instances plus explicit connections originating from the
Livebook tag on TCP 4369 and 9100-9105. Livebook has no `cluster_name` label, so
portal discovery never adds it automatically.

The load balancer uses DB-independent `/healthz` for auto-healing and DB-aware
`/readyz` for traffic eligibility. Backend HTTP accepts only Google proxy and
health-check source ranges. Public traffic terminates TLS at the load balancer.

## Private emisar administration

Every portal VM runs a dedicated `emisar-admin` runner directly under systemd.
Cloud-init fetches the pinned immutable runner bundle and its published
`SHA256SUMS` from `https://emisar.dev/releases`, verifies the selected artifact,
and installs it under `/run/emisar-admin-runner/bin`. This avoids a boot-time
GitHub API dependency. COS
mounts writable persistent paths `noexec`, so config, durable dispatch state,
packs, and logs remain under `/var/lib/emisar-admin-runner` while the
boot-recreatable binary lives on executable tmpfs. Cloud-init also writes the
unlisted `infra/packs/emisar-admin` pack directly from the Terraform module. The
verified release bundle seeds a fixed host operations set on first boot:
`linux-core`, `debugging`, `systemd-deep`, `cloud-init`, `docker`, `nic`,
`time-sync`, and `elixir-beam`. A runner-only bridge maps the three BEAM
toolchain checks to fixed, read-only RPC expressions in the colocated portal
release; it rejects every other invocation. The combined `firewall` pack is
removed because COS has no `nft` CLI, so its complete dependency contract cannot
be met. Service startup checks the remaining packs' declared host dependencies
before the runner advertises them. Every pack in the curated host set, plus
the public GCP, HCP Terraform, and Sentry packs used by this runner, is then reconciled to its exact
version and content hash from the public registry on every service start, so
pack updates do not wait for another runner release. The set is curated instead
of host-detected: COS includes unused clients and shared ports that falsely
suggest Kubernetes, Prometheus, Postgres, and Git packs. The runner advertises
group `emisar-admin` with `purpose=emisar-admin`; local admission
allows the private actions, those eight host packs, `hcp-terraform`, and the GCP
certificate, Cloud SQL, compute, DNS, IAM, load-balancing, monitoring,
networking, and storage packs at every declared risk tier. The GCP credentials
remain read-only, so mutation actions are visible but Google refuses them. The
HCP token is organization-owner-equivalent (Free has no RBAC), so the runner's
admission subtracts the run-mutating HCP actions (`tfc.apply_run`,
`discard_run`, `cancel_run`, `retry_run`, `force_unlock_workspace`); reads,
plan-only runs, and the ordinary lock/unlock stay. Confirm & Apply in HCP
remains the one deploy gate, reachable from no runner.

Set the reusable runner enrollment credential as the sensitive HCP
Terraform variable `emisar_runner_enrollment_key`. A regional MIG can create
several runners and replaces their boot disks during rollouts, so a single-use
key is insufficient. Issue the key in the management account with enough uses
for the fleet and rollout surge. Changing the variable automatically writes and
deploys a new exact Secret Manager version without storing the payload in state.
Set the HCP Terraform API token separately as the sensitive workspace variable
`emisar_tfe_token`; changing it likewise writes and rolls to an exact managed
secret version.

This is a fully trusted administration runner. It runs on the COS host and its
fixed script uses `docker exec emisar /app/bin/emisar rpc` to call the
colocated release, so compromising the runner is equivalent to compromising the
portal VM. The fixed pack passes its already-validated action arguments to one
private Elixir entrypoint; the normal action run remains the audit record.

After the first rollout, trust the exact `emisar-admin` hash the new runners in
the management account advertise — the version travels with the pack, so read it
off the advertisement rather than from here. Critical erasure actions remain
subject to the management account's normal policy and approval rules.

The pinned `runner-v0.28.0` release understands the current pack setup and
structured output schemas; the private pack does not require a custom runner
build.

## Portal VM operations

Use `./run ops portal` for IAP and OS Login access to the portal fleet. It limits
the picker to instances carrying the `cluster_name=emisar` label, supports fzf
multi-selection for read-only inspection and commands, and caches the selection
per shell session for repeated checks.

```sh
./run ops portal status
./run ops portal logs
./run ops portal --host emisar-example-a logs -f
./run ops portal version
./run ops portal remsh
./run ops portal cmd 'uptime && free -h'
./run ops portal --reuse-last-selection logs
./run ops portal --list-hosts
./run ops portal --host emisar-example-a --host emisar-example-b version
```

The helper uses the active gcloud project by default. Pass `--project`, or set
`EMISAR_GCP_PROJECT`, when the active configuration points elsewhere. `gcloud`
and, for interactive selection, `fzf` are required; the operator must have IAP
tunnel and OS Login access. `--list-hosts` prints one eligible VM name per line
for automation, and repeated `--host` options select exact VMs without fzf.

## Livebook admin workbench

The optional Livebook instance is a production admin/debug host. Enable it with
`livebook_enabled=true`, set its sizing as workspace variables, and set the
sensitive `livebook_iap_iam_user` to one lowercase Google Workspace user. The VM
has no public address. `https://livebook.<domain>` reaches a dedicated backend
through the shared HTTPS load balancer and grants only that principal the
resource-level IAP web-app role.

IAP uses Google's managed browser OAuth client; no OAuth client secret is
created or committed. Livebook receives
`LIVEBOOK_IDENTITY_PROVIDER=google_iap:<signed-jwt-audience>` and validates the
signed IAP assertion itself. `LIVEBOOK_TOKEN_ENABLED=false` and no
`LIVEBOOK_PASSWORD` is configured. Opening the URL therefore uses the current
Google/IAP browser identity automatically and never presents a second Livebook
login. Google's managed client is intentionally limited to users inside the
project's organization. The load balancer sends only Livebook's `/public/*`
health, tokenized input, and widget-asset routes to a separate non-IAP backend;
this is required because widgets load from `livebookusercontent.com` without an
operator IAP cookie. Every other route retains the IAP backend as its default.

Notebooks and Livebook configuration persist on the separately protected
`emisar-livebook-data` disk, mounted at `/data` in the container. Saved notebooks
live under `/data/notebooks`; Livebook configuration is
`/data/.livebook/livebook_config.v1.ets`. The VM boot disk and container are
disposable. Unsaved sessions are not a backup, and this stack does not create
automatic disk snapshots. Snapshot the data disk before high-risk notebook or
configuration changes.

The version-controlled product dashboard pack is seeded into
`/data/notebooks/Emisar Product Analytics` only when a file is missing. Reboots
and instance replacements therefore preserve operator edits, while Git remains
the recovery source for the canonical dashboards. Adding a new canonical file
seeds it on the next data-preparation run; changing an existing canonical file
does not overwrite the saved copy. The container runs as an unprivileged user
with a read-only root filesystem and an independently pinned image.
Mix and Hex build artifacts live in an executable, bounded
`/home/livebook` tmpfs because `Mix.install/1` runs downloaded build tools;
that dependency cache is intentionally discarded on service restart. Only
notebooks and Livebook configuration persist on `/data`.
`/public/health` and ephemeral widget assets remain available without IAP; every
operator route requires a valid IAP assertion.

The local Cloud SQL Auth Proxy logs in as the dedicated Livebook service account
and Cloud SQL assigns it `emisar_owner` plus read-only `pg_read_all_stats` for
statement diagnostics. `DATABASE_URL` and standard `PG*` variables are available
inside notebooks; there is no database password. Analysis connections must
retain the read-only defaults exposed by the runtime:

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:postgrex, "~> 0.22.0"},
  {:kino, "~> 0.19.0"},
  {:kino_vega_lite, "~> 0.1.13"}
])

Code.require_file("/opt/emisar/product_analytics.exs")
db = EmisarProductAnalytics.connect!()
```

This is an accidental-write guard, not a privilege boundary: the shared Erlang
cookie already makes the workbench fully trusted. Portal attachment is always
explicit. Discover current private node names from a notebook runtime, then
connect only to the node being debugged:

```elixir
{nodes, 0} = System.cmd("/bin/bash", ["/opt/emisar/list-portal-nodes"])
nodes
# => "emisar@10.x.x.x\n..."

Node.connect(:"emisar@10.x.x.x")
```

The Livebook node and its standalone notebook runtimes inherit the exact release
cookie, but no automatic cluster strategy is configured and no distribution
port is opened toward Livebook.

## Secrets

Externally issued credentials are sensitive HCP Terraform workspace variables.
`SECRET_KEY_BASE` and `RELEASE_COOKIE` are separate values with independent
generations. Production database access uses IAM and no DATABASE_URL secret
version exists. The protected empty container remains only to avoid destructive
removal and name reuse; retained access evidence lives in the locked logging
bucket. Adding a secret requires:

1. A sensitive variable in `variables.tf` when the value is externally issued.
2. A Terraform-managed secret container and an `app_secrets` entry in `secrets.tf`.
3. An `optional_secret_values` entry when the application can boot without it.
4. The minimum per-secret IAM binding for the instance service account.

Never place values in git, defaults, command history, or `.tfvars` files.

Write-only values never enter state, so `secret_data_wo_version` is the only
signal a payload changed. Externally-issued credentials (Paddle, Postmark,
Sentry, Mixpanel, X Ads) and the runner enrollment key and TFE token derive
that trigger from a hash of the payload itself, so changing the workspace value
IS the rotation — the new version and the instance-template roll follow from
it.

Two secrets cannot do that and keep a hand-maintained counter, because their
payloads are ephemeral or Terraform-generated and hashing them would rotate on
every apply: `emisar-secret-key-base` and `emisar-release-cookie`. Rotate
either by incrementing only its entry in `local.secret_generations`, in the
same change as the workspace value. The resulting exact version is part of
cloud-init, so the instance template rolls and no VM ever follows the mutable
`latest` alias.

The first cookie cutover is special: leave `release_cookie_ready=false`. First
prove every serving VM is healthy and uses one instance template, then read the
numeric `emisar-secret-key-base` version embedded in that template's rendered
startup script. Never use `latest`: an out-of-band newer version is not
necessarily the value running VMs use. This command intentionally fails until
the new exact-version template has fully rolled out.

The `gcloud secrets versions access` below reads `emisar-secret-key-base` as
your own principal, which is not one of the expected readers, so expect and
acknowledge one "Unexpected Secret Manager Access" alert for yourself — it is
the guard working, not a separate incident.

```sh
mig=$(terraform output -raw mig_name)
instances=$(gcloud compute instance-groups managed list-instances "$mig" \
  --project emisar --region us-central1 --format=json)
jq -e 'length > 0 and all(.[];
  .instanceStatus == "RUNNING" and .currentAction == "NONE" and
  all(.instanceHealth[]?; .detailedHealthState == "HEALTHY"))' <<<"$instances"
templates=$(jq -r '.[].version.instanceTemplate | split("/")[-1]' \
  <<<"$instances" | sort -u)
[ "$(printf '%s\n' "$templates" | sed '/^$/d' | wc -l | tr -d ' ')" = 1 ]
template=$templates
secret_version=$(gcloud compute instance-templates describe "$template" \
  --project emisar --format=json |
  jq -r '.properties.metadata.items[] | select(.key == "user-data") | .value' |
  sed -n 's/.*fetch_secret "emisar-secret-key-base" "\([0-9][0-9]*\)" "SECRET_KEY_BASE".*/\1/p')
[ -n "$secret_version" ]
umask 077
gcloud secrets versions access "$secret_version" --project emisar \
  --secret emisar-secret-key-base |
  { IFS= read -r value; printf 'emisar-release-cookie:%s' "$value" | openssl dgst -sha256 -r | cut -d' ' -f1; } \
  > /tmp/emisar-release-cookie
```

Store that file's value as sensitive ephemeral `release_cookie_value`, securely
delete the local file, and then choose the staged consumer. Enabling Livebook
while `release_cookie_ready=false` writes that exact value for Livebook without
changing the portal template; portal nodes continue deriving the same cookie.
Setting `release_cookie_ready=true` is the later, separately reviewed portal
rollout onto the already-matching secret. Old and new nodes therefore use
identical cookies throughout. Rotate signing and cookie values separately in
later maintenance windows: first prove no migration/long-running job is in
flight; increment only the affected generation; retain the preceding Secret
Manager version; watch ready backends and cluster-failure alerts until every VM
uses the same template; verify a single cluster and user/session behavior. A
failed cookie rotation is recovered by writing the preceding value at a new
generation and rolling forward, never by following `latest` or decrementing a
write-only generation.

## Database IAM and pgAudit

Production database access is IAM-only. The VM identity logs in through the
loopback Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, then assumes the non-login `emisar_owner` role for
migrations and application queries. `tests/database/verify-iam.sql` proves the
login is not elevated, verifies application and pgAudit ownership, and performs
a reversible DDL probe.

Personal operator access is optional and attributable. Set the sensitive HCP
Terraform workspace variable `database_operator_iam_user` to one lowercase
Google user email. Terraform provisions that identity as a Cloud SQL IAM user,
grants connector login only on the `emisar` instance, grants the project-level
console discovery permissions Cloud SQL Studio requires, and assigns the
non-superuser `emisar_owner` and read-only `pg_read_all_stats` database roles.
The Portal runtime does not receive the statistics role. The database principal
itself exists only on `emisar`. Cloud SQL Studio is the browser-based path:
select the `emisar` database and IAM authentication in the instance's Studio
view; there is no database password.

For a local psql session from an operator workstation, authenticate gcloud as
that provisioned user, then run the database helper:

```bash
gcloud auth login
./run ops database --psql              # interactive psql
./run ops database --psql -- --command='select current_user;'
```

For a long-lived Postico 2 or `--proxy-only` session, automatic IAM token
refresh requires matching Application Default Credentials:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
./run ops database
```

The helper selects a running portal VM, opens a local SOCKS5 route to it through
IAP and OS Login, and sends the local Cloud SQL Auth Proxy's private-IP traffic
through that route. The Auth Proxy still runs on the workstation under the
active gcloud identity for psql or matching ADC for a long-lived client, so IAM
database authentication and pgAudit attribution remain personal; the portal VM
supplies network reachability only.
By default the helper opens Postico 2 and keeps the tunnel alive until Ctrl-C.
Use `--psql` for a terminal client, or `--proxy-only` to print local connection
settings for another client and keep the tunnel open. The database remains
private-only.

`pg_stat_statements` is installed in the production database for cumulative
query-cost evidence. Query it through the attributable operator session; keep
the reset timestamp beside every capture so old query fingerprints are not
mistaken for current traffic:

```sql
SELECT stats_reset FROM pg_stat_statements_info;

SELECT queryid, calls,
       round(total_exec_time::numeric, 1) AS total_ms,
       round(mean_exec_time::numeric, 1) AS mean_ms,
       rows, query
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

The built-in `emisar` principal remains because it owns pgAudit's protected
event triggers. Terraform gives it a generated apply-only password that is
never exposed as plaintext in Terraform state or Secret Manager; Cloud SQL keeps
only what it needs to verify logins. No DATABASE_URL version or VM secret access
remains.

Disaster recovery uses PITR, which preserves the roles, extensions, and
migrations. Run the verifier against the restored database before serving
traffic. The repository does not retain completed one-time database-bootstrap
or project-cleanup mutation scripts.

### Promoting a restored clone

PITR always produces a NEW instance, and everything in this configuration that
names the database derives from `google_sql_database_instance.emisar` — the
proxy connection name baked into cloud-init, every Cloud SQL IAM condition
(`cloudsql_instance_only_condition`), and the four `google_sql_user` rows — so a
restore is served by teaching Terraform that the clone IS `emisar`, never by
re-creating the instance. The old instance carries `prevent_destroy` and both
deletion-protection flags, so nothing below can destroy it by accident. In
order, from a workstation signed in to gcloud as the provisioned database
operator, with authority to clone Cloud SQL instances and edit project IAM:

1. Clone: `gcloud sql instances clone emisar emisar-restore-<yyyymmddhhmm>
   --point-in-time=<RFC 3339>` (the drill does exactly this at now−5 min).
2. Verify the clone in isolation. `./run ops drill pitr` cannot do this: it
   only exercises its own scratch clone. The operator's Cloud SQL grants cover
   only `emisar`, so grant them on the clone for the check, run the verifier
   and a freshness query there, and read the same values from production as
   they stood at the restore point:

   ```bash
   for role in roles/cloudsql.client roles/cloudsql.instanceUser; do
     gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <project> \
       --member=user:<operator> --role=$role \
       --condition='expression=resource.name == "projects/<project>/instances/emisar-restore-<stamp>" && resource.type == "sqladmin.googleapis.com/Instance",title=emisar_restore_verification'
   done
   ./run ops database --instance emisar-restore-<stamp> --psql -- \
     -v expected_session_user=<operator> \
     --file=infra/tests/database/verify-iam.sql \
     --command='SELECT (SELECT max(version) FROM schema_migrations) AS newest_migration, (SELECT max(inserted_at) FROM audit_events) AS newest_audit_event;'
   ./run ops database --psql -- \
     --command="SELECT (SELECT max(version) FROM schema_migrations WHERE inserted_at <= '<point>') AS newest_migration, (SELECT max(inserted_at) FROM audit_events WHERE inserted_at <= '<point>') AS newest_audit_event;"
   ```

   `<point>` is step 1's `--point-in-time` written in UTC (`…Z`), because
   those columns have no time zone. The last command only reads production.
   Promote only if the verifier exits 0 and both rows match. Stop and clone
   again at a corrected point if the verifier fails, if the rows differ, or if
   `<point>` is not before the first bad write or lies further back than the
   committed RPO. Either way, remove both grants afterwards with
   `gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding` and the same `--member`,
   `--role` and `--condition`; only an exact match removes a conditional
   binding. A first denial can be IAM propagation; retry after a minute.
3. Point Terraform at the clone. `instance` forces replacement of the
   `google_sql_database` and `google_sql_user` rows, so they move with the
   instance or the plan stops on `prevent_destroy`. From `infra/` after
   `terraform login`, list them with `terraform state list | grep '^google_sql_'`.
   In one commit, set `name = "emisar-restore-<stamp>"` on the `emisar` instance
   resource and add temporary `import` blocks to `database.tf`, one per listed
   address:

   ```hcl
   import {
     to = google_sql_database_instance.emisar
     id = "projects/${var.project_id}/instances/emisar-restore-<stamp>"
   }
   import {
     to = google_sql_database.emisar
     id = "projects/${var.project_id}/instances/emisar-restore-<stamp>/databases/emisar"
   }
   import {
     to = google_sql_user.pgaudit_owner
     id = "${var.project_id}/emisar-restore-<stamp>/emisar"
   }
   import {
     to = google_sql_user.emisar_vm[0]
     id = "${var.project_id}/emisar-restore-<stamp>/${trimsuffix(google_service_account.vm.email, ".gserviceaccount.com")}"
   }
   import {
     to = google_sql_user.database_operator[0]
     id = "${var.project_id}/emisar-restore-<stamp>/${var.database_operator_iam_user}"
   }
   import {
     to = google_sql_user.livebook[0]
     id = "${var.project_id}/emisar-restore-<stamp>/${trimsuffix(google_service_account.livebook[0].email, ".gserviceaccount.com")}"
   }
   ```

   The clone already holds this database and these users, so they are imported,
   never created. The imports run in the HCP plan, where the sensitive variables
   live; a local `terraform import` cannot evaluate them. Once CI passes, apply
   no other run until step 4 finishes, remove the listed addresses from state in
   one write (check with `-dry-run` first), then merge:

   ```bash
   terraform state rm google_sql_database_instance.emisar google_sql_database.emisar \
     google_sql_user.pgaudit_owner 'google_sql_user.emisar_vm[0]' \
     'google_sql_user.database_operator[0]' 'google_sql_user.livebook[0]'
   ```

   `state rm` only forgets; the old instance and its rows stay intact. It must
   precede the plan, because Terraform skips an import whose address is still
   in state.
4. Plan and Confirm & Apply the merged commit's saved plan (rerun its
   `deployment-plan` job if it planned before the `state rm`). It must import
   every listed address; a `prevent_destroy` error means step 3 missed one.
   Expect in-place updates to `pgaudit_owner` (a fresh apply-only password) and
   to the IAM users' `database_roles` (re-asserted; the provider does not read
   them back), replacement of the instance-scoped IAM bindings, and replacement
   of the instance template with the clone's connection name, which rolls the
   MIG — the application cutover that the ≈30-minute slice of the 2 h RTO
   budget covers. Delete the `import` blocks in the next commit. When Livebook
   runs, the plan also updates its VM metadata in place, but its database proxy
   takes the connection name only at boot, so restart it once the apply
   finishes: `gcloud compute instances stop emisar-livebook --zone <zone>`, then
   `gcloud compute instances start emisar-livebook --zone <zone>`, where
   `<zone>` is the first entry of `zones`.
5. Verify from outside (sign-in, a run, the audit page) and only then stop the
   old instance with `gcloud sql instances patch emisar --activation-policy
   NEVER`; keep it for the backup retention window before deleting it and
   removing it from the `emisar_database_only` condition history.

The served instance keeps the clone's name. From then on, pass
`--instance emisar-restore-<stamp>` to `./run ops database`; without it the
helper targets the retired instance.

`./run ops drill pitr --apply` rehearses step 1 plus an `emisar_owner` login on
its own scratch clone, which it then deletes; keep its manifest as the RPO
evidence. Step 2 and steps 3–5 run only against a real retained clone.

pgAudit records only `ROLE` and `DDL`. In Cloud Audit Logs these are Data Access
entries with `protoPayload.methodName=cloudsql.instances.query`; parameters are
disabled and normal `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` workload traffic
is excluded. The security evidence sink retains those entries for 400 days.

## Backup monitoring

Failed backup operations trigger a log-based alert. Backup age is not polled;
a schedule that stops without a failure event does not trigger this alert.

## Terraform authority

The single HCP Terraform workspace owns the complete project-scoped production
stack, including IAM, WIF, secret containers, and workload resources. Its HCP
token and apply identity are production-admin credentials. Organization Policy
administration is intentionally excluded: Google grants that authority above
the project, where it would also cover unrelated projects in the organization.

## DNS and DNSSEC

`dns.tf` is the complete authoritative zone. Add durable records there before
expecting them to resolve publicly. Cloud DNS supplies the apex NS and SOA
records itself.

DNSSEC is complete: Cloud DNS signs the zone and the registrar publishes the
current key-signing DS, so validating resolvers authenticate the chain from
`.dev` to `emisar.dev`. Verify the live chain with:

```sh
dig +short DS emisar.dev
dig @1.1.1.1 +dnssec emisar.dev A
dig @8.8.8.8 +dnssec emisar.dev A
```

Every registrar DS must appear in `terraform output -json dnssec_ds_record`; both resolver
responses must contain the `ad` flag. A future DNSSEC key rotation follows the
same parent/child ordering discipline: publish the replacement DS only after the
new child key is active, and remove the old DS only after resolver convergence.

## Pack registry

`registry.emisar.dev` terminates at the shared load balancer and routes directly
to one public-read GCS bucket. The publisher can create, but cannot replace or
delete, objects under `v1/packs/`, `v1/catalog/`, and `v1/schemas/`. It can
replace or delete only the four exact live pointers: `v1/catalog.json`,
`v1/suggest.json`, `packs.json`, and `packs/suggest.json`. The latter two are
byte-identical facade aliases for bucket-only registries; GCS requires delete
permission to replace an object. A repeated immutable publication fetches the
existing object and verifies its bytes before treating the collision as
idempotent. Bucket versioning retains recent previous generations of all four
pointers.

The registry and MTA-STS hosts are backend BUCKETS, so the per-IP rate limit in
`security_policy.tf` does not reach them: a backend bucket takes only an
`edge_security_policy`, and a Cloud Armor edge policy cannot carry
`rate_limit_options`. What bounds them instead is Cloud CDN plus the
`Cache-Control` the publisher stamps per object — every immutable artifact is
served from the edge, and only the four live pointers are `no-store` and reach
the origin on every request. Bounding those four needs a caching contract change
in `packs/PUBLISHING.md` and the publisher, not a Terraform edit.

```sh
curl -fsS https://registry.emisar.dev/v1/catalog.json | jq '.schema_version'
gcloud storage ls -a gs://$(terraform output -raw pack_registry_bucket)/v1/catalog.json
gcloud storage ls -a gs://$(terraform output -raw pack_registry_bucket)/packs.json
```

Pack publication runs after exact-head CI through the protected-main
`pack-registry-production` environment. It has no second reviewer in the
solo-founder release flow, is serialized, and refuses a commit superseded by
newer `main`, so an active publication cannot be canceled halfway through.

## Release artifacts

`https://emisar.dev/releases/*` routes through the shared load balancer to the
same public-read GCS bucket. Runner and MCP release workflows authenticate with
the `emisar-release-publisher` identity. It can create objects only under
`releases/`; a small custom role permits replacing the two `latest.json`
pointers and nothing else.

Versioned archives, checksums, and manifests are create-only. A workflow
verifies the public Emisar copy before publishing the identical GitHub Release
as a secondary mirror. The `latest.json` pointer advances only after every
referenced object exists and never moves to an older semantic version. Bucket
versioning retains previous pointer generations.

```sh
curl -fsS https://emisar.dev/releases/runner/latest.json | jq '.tag'
curl -fsS https://emisar.dev/releases/mcp/latest.json | jq '.tag'
```

## Recovery drills

Run `./run ops drill cleanup --apply` before and after every exercise; after
client loss an operator must run its 12-hour janitor mode to find abandoned
labeled/prefixed resources. It is intentionally supervised rather than backed by
a persistent cross-service delete identity. `./run ops drill pitr` is dry-run
by default. With `--apply` it clones a recent PITR point into a uniquely named
scratch instance, creates a temporary scoped IAM principal and private probe VM,
proves restored data through `emisar_owner`, and runs the independent janitor on
exit. A successful drill still fails if cleanup or final inventory verification
fails. It never patches, stops, or routes traffic to production. Evidence
manifests live under the git-ignored `.agent/drills/`; record actual RPO/RTO and
retain the empty-inventory result.

## Outputs

Useful non-secret outputs:

```sh
terraform output url
terraform output lb_ipv4
terraform output lb_ipv6
terraform output nameservers
terraform output status_page_url
terraform output pack_registry_base_url
terraform output livebook_url
```

## Validation

Run from the repository root:

```sh
./run gate infra
```

The gate checks formatting, initializes without the remote backend, validates,
runs TFLint, and validates rendered cloud-init. It is credential-free. A live
plan or apply is a separate,
credentials-gated production action performed through HCP Terraform.
