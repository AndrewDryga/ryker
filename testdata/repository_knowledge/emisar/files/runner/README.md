# emisar runner

The runner is the local enforcement and execution layer for emisar. It loads
the action packs installed on a host, dials out to the control plane, and checks
every dispatched action against the local pack before it starts a process. The
runner opens an outbound TLS WebSocket and exposes no inbound listener; commands
return through that established connection.

Run one runner on every host that an agent should be able to inspect or change.
The runner uses the permissions of its service user; emisar does not turn a
permitted command into a sandbox.

## Install and prove it works

The supported production target is Linux with systemd. macOS with launchd is
available for development and evaluation. Install GitHub CLI with
`gh attestation verify --bundle` to check release signatures, and allow HTTPS to
`tuf-repo-cdn.sigstore.dev:443` and `tuf-repo.github.com:443` so it can load the
public trust roots; without GitHub CLI the installer and `emisar update` ask at a
terminal, or warn and continue unattended, on the checksum alone. Release
verification does not require a GitHub login.

1. In the emisar console, choose **Connect a runner**. The generated command
   contains the control-plane URL and a fresh, single-use enrollment key.
2. Run that command on the host:

   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://emisar.dev/install.sh \
     | sudo EMISAR_ENROLLMENT_KEY=emkey-enroll-... EMISAR_URL=https://emisar.dev bash
   ```

   The installer authenticates the signed release checksum, verifies the
   archive against it, creates a dedicated `emisar` user on Linux, installs the
   service, adds host-matched starter packs, and starts the runner.
3. Verify the host and the control-plane connection:

   ```sh
   sudo emisar status
   ```

4. Confirm the runner is online in the console. Dispatch `linux.uptime` with
   a reason and check that the result appears in the audit trail.

`emisar status` reads the running daemon's owner-only local snapshot and reports
its last successful heartbeat send, advertised catalog, process uptime, and
in-flight run count. The console remains authoritative for whether the control
plane currently sees the runner. If status reports a problem, `emisar doctor`
checks configuration, credentials, pack contents, required host binaries, and
control-plane reachability without opening a cloud session.

The complete operator walkthrough is at
[emisar.dev/docs/quickstart](https://emisar.dev/docs/quickstart). Container and
Kubernetes installations are covered at
[emisar.dev/docs/containers](https://emisar.dev/docs/containers).

## What the runner enforces

For every action, the runner:

1. Resolves the action from its own loaded pack catalog.
2. Recomputes the pack's content hash and compares it with the hash trusted by
   the control plane.
3. Re-validates every argument against the pack's typed schema and rejects
   unknown input.
4. Applies the host-local action allowlist, denylist, and optional risk ceiling.
5. Clamps timeout and output limits to the pack's declared bounds.
6. Executes the pack-authored binary and argv with `os/exec`.
7. Redacts runner output before it leaves the host. The control plane keeps the
   redacted output in run history and records terminal metadata in the audit.
8. Appends the attempt to a hash-chained local JSONL journal.

Fixed shell programs may be authored inside a pack when pipes or shell features
are needed, but cloud input is still limited to validated substitutions. The
staging-only `shell` pack is the explicit arbitrary-command exception and must
not be installed on production runners.

See the [security model](../.agent/kb/specs/security-model.md),
[architecture](../.agent/kb/architecture.md), and
[runner wire protocol](../.agent/kb/specs/wire-protocol.md) for the full contract.

## Files and configuration

The supervised installer uses these paths by default:

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/usr/local/bin/emisar` | Runner and operator CLI |
| `/etc/emisar/config.yaml` | Host identity, control-plane URL, packs, admission, and execution settings |
| `/etc/emisar/runner.env` | Mode-0600 enrollment key and pack credentials |
| `/etc/emisar/packs/` | Installed action packs |
| `/var/lib/emisar/` | Per-runner token and durable execution state |
| `/var/lib/emisar/runtime-status.json` | Mode-0600 advisory daemon health snapshot for `emisar status` |
| `/var/log/emisar/events.jsonl` | Hash-chained local security journal |

The portal-generated install command writes the URL and enrollment key for you.
For manual provisioning, the minimum shape is:

```yaml
schema_version: 1

runner:
  group: web-prod
  labels:
    region: us-east-1
    environment: prod

cloud:
  url: wss://emisar.dev
  enrollment_key_env: EMISAR_ENROLLMENT_KEY
  token_path: /var/lib/emisar/token

paths:
  data_dir: /var/lib/emisar
  packs:
    - /etc/emisar/packs

execution: {}

events:
  jsonl_path: /var/log/emisar/events.jsonl
```

Groups and labels organize the fleet and participate in scoping. Treat their
names as durable operational identifiers. The full annotated configuration is
[`examples/config.yaml`](examples/config.yaml).

## Pack credentials

Pack credentials stay on the host. They are never passed as action arguments.

1. Put each value in `/etc/emisar/runner.env`:

   ```sh
   NOMAD_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:4646
   NOMAD_TOKEN=<acl-token>
   ```

2. Allowlist the variable names in `/etc/emisar/config.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   execution:
     inherit_env:
       - NOMAD_ADDR
       - NOMAD_TOKEN
   ```

3. Restart the service so both files are re-read:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl restart emisar
   ```

The runner always provides `PATH`, `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, and `TERM`; everything
else is dropped unless it is allowlisted. Run `emisar pack info <id>` to see a
pack's binaries, environment variables, privilege needs, and verification
action. The installer preserves both configuration files during upgrades.

## Install and manage packs

The installer adds a small host-matched starter set. Add capabilities by name
from the public registry, by pinned version, from a local directory, or from an
HTTPS tarball:

```sh
sudo emisar pack install redis
sudo emisar pack install redis=0.2.3 --hash sha256:...
sudo emisar pack install ./my-pack
sudo emisar pack info redis
```

The runner validates every pack before installing it. When a daemon is running,
pack install, update, and uninstall signal it to reload and re-advertise without
dropping in-flight work. Otherwise run `sudo systemctl reload emisar`.

Browse the catalog at [emisar.dev/packs](https://emisar.dev/packs) and read the
[pack guide](../packs/README.md) before installing capabilities on production
hosts.

## Local admission

Admission is the host's defense-in-depth gate. It hides and refuses actions
that should never be available on that runner, even if the control plane asks
for one.

```yaml
admission:
  allow:
    - "linux.*"
    - "postgres.uptime"
  deny:
    - "*.repair"
    - "linux.systemctl_restart"
  max_risk: medium
```

An action must match `allow` when that list is present, must not match `deny`,
and must not exceed `max_risk`. Empty admission settings accept every action in
the locally installed catalog.

## Operations

| Task | Linux | macOS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Start | `sudo systemctl start emisar` | `sudo launchctl bootstrap system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.emisar.runner.plist` |
| Stop | `sudo systemctl stop emisar` | `sudo launchctl bootout system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.emisar.runner.plist` |
| Restart | `sudo systemctl restart emisar` | bootout, then bootstrap |
| Runner health | `sudo emisar status` | `sudo emisar status` |
| Service state | `sudo systemctl status emisar` | `sudo launchctl print system/com.emisar.runner` |
| Follow logs | `sudo journalctl -u emisar -f` | `tail -f /var/log/emisar/emisar.err.log` |
| Reload packs and signing trust | `sudo systemctl reload emisar` | `sudo launchctl kill HUP system/com.emisar.runner` |
| Tail the local journal | `sudo emisar events tail` | `sudo emisar events tail` |
| Verify the journal chain | `sudo emisar audit verify` | `sudo emisar audit verify` |

The Linux unit uses `Restart=on-failure`, a five-attempt restart burst cap, and
a seven-minute graceful shutdown window. The cap prevents a bad or revoked
credential from causing an endless authentication loop. The shutdown window
covers the longest bundled cancellation grace.

The default 30-second heartbeat pairs with the portal's stale-socket watchdog
and connection lease. The portal closes a connection 90 seconds after the last
heartbeat, so `cloud.heartbeat_every` is capped at 45 seconds and a wider value
is refused at load rather than becoming a silent reconnect loop. A half-open
network path can take roughly 90-120 seconds to release ownership before a
replacement connection is accepted. Reducing the runner's reconnect backoff
does not bypass that safety window.

## Upgrade and remove

An installer-managed runner updates itself without changing its configuration,
credentials, packs, or local evidence:

```sh
sudo emisar update
```

Pin a reviewed release when needed:

```sh
sudo emisar update --version X.Y.Z
```

The command works only for runners installed by `install.sh`. Copied binaries,
containers, packages, and infrastructure-managed runners must be updated by
their deployment system. The updater downloads the release, verifies the signed
`SHA256SUMS` metadata and archive checksum, then runs the installer bundled in
that release.

Fresh unattended installs require an explicit pack set. Pass reviewed pack IDs
or set an empty value to add none:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://emisar.dev/install.sh | sudo EMISAR_PACKS="" bash -s -- --yes
```

To remove the service while retaining configuration and local evidence:

```sh
sudo bash install.sh --uninstall
```

The default uninstall deletes the cached runner token but keeps `/etc/emisar`,
`/var/lib/emisar`, and `/var/log/emisar`. Add `--purge` to delete them too.

## Signed dispatch (optional)

A runner can require every action to carry intent signed by the MCP bridge with
an Ed25519 or ECDSA P-256 leaf key. The control plane can relay that action but
cannot originate it, change its exact arguments, or widen its runner set.

Run `emisar signing init`, add the generated CA public key under
`signing.trusted_cas`, and configure the MCP bridge with the leaf key and
certificate. Setup, scope, rotation, replay protection, and refusal codes are in
[the signed-dispatch specification](../.agent/kb/specs/signed-dispatch.md).

## Hardening (optional)

On Linux, every action child always enters `no_new_privs` before it executes.
That is part of the runner's execution boundary, independent of systemd and
not an optional hardening setting. It prevents setuid/setgid helpers and file
capabilities on action binaries from adding privileges anywhere in the action's
process tree.

The daemon also marks itself non-dumpable at start. The kernel keeps a copy of
the environment `runner.env` loaded (the enrollment key and every pack
credential) under `/proc/<pid>/environ`, and the bearer token lives in the
process memory behind `/proc/<pid>/mem`; non-dumpable, those entries are
root-owned and no same-user action child can read or attach to them, whatever
the host's `ptrace_scope`. The runner's own `/proc/<pid>` tree is also a
protected root for every path argument, so `/proc/self/environ` is refused
before an action runs. `/proc/net` and `/proc/mounts` are links into the calling
process's own entry, so a path argument naming them is refused too;
`linux.network_interfaces` and `linux.mount_status` read that state instead.
Every other process stays as inspectable as before, so
`ProtectProc=` is still the directive that breaks `/proc` diagnostics, not this.

The installed systemd unit is deliberately modest because every service
sandbox directive also constrains the actions it launches. For example:

| Directive | Common consequence |
| --- | --- |
| `ProtectSystem=strict` | Blocks actions that write outside declared writable paths |
| `ProtectHome=yes` | Blocks reads under `/home` |
| `ProtectProc=invisible` | Breaks process and `/proc` diagnostics |
| `PrivateDevices=yes` | Blocks storage and device actions |
| `MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes` | Breaks JIT runtimes |

Add a systemd drop-in only after checking every installed pack against the
restrictions. Drop-ins survive installer upgrades. A strong read-mostly host
profile can start with:

```ini
[Service]
PrivateTmp=yes
ProtectSystem=strict
ProtectHome=yes
ReadWritePaths=/var/lib/emisar /var/log/emisar
ProtectKernelTunables=yes
ProtectKernelModules=yes
ProtectKernelLogs=yes
ProtectControlGroups=yes
ProtectClock=yes
ProtectHostname=yes
RestrictRealtime=yes
LockPersonality=yes
SystemCallArchitectures=native
```

Install it under `/etc/systemd/system/emisar.service.d/harden.conf`, run
`sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, restart the service, and use `emisar doctor`
plus representative local action runs to prove the profile fits the host.

## Giving actions the OS access they need

The default Linux service user is unprivileged. Grant only the OS authority
required by the packs installed on that host. An action cannot gain authority
through `sudo`, another setuid/setgid helper, or file capabilities on the binary
it executes: `no_new_privs` blocks all three. A sudoers rule for `emisar` will
never elevate an action.

Prefer direct, narrow access. Add the `emisar` user to a group that already owns
the resource, or grant an ACL on the exact socket, file, or directory the pack
needs. For a privileged operation exposed by a local service, use that service's
authorization boundary instead of changing the action process's identity.

For systemd actions, prefer a narrow polkit rule:

```javascript
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
    if (action.id == "org.freedesktop.systemd1.manage-units" &&
        subject.user == "emisar") {
        var unit = action.lookup("unit");
        if (unit == "nginx.service" || unit == "cassandra.service") {
            return polkit.Result.YES;
        }
    }
});
```

An action may declare `execution.user` to drop to a different local identity,
but the runner service must already have authority to make that switch. The
default unprivileged service cannot become another user. Do not run the service
as root in production merely to make an action work; that turns a runner
compromise into full host compromise. Give the dedicated service identity the
smallest direct or mediated access the installed packs actually need.

## Development

Build from the repository root:

```sh
(cd runner && go build -o ../bin/emisar .)
./bin/emisar --config ./runner/examples/config.yaml state
```

The module gate is:

```sh
./run gate runner
```

CLI commands live at the module root. Runtime packages are under `internal/`;
the public pack manifest types are in `pkg/actionspec` and `pkg/packspec`.
Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) before changing the execution or trust boundary.
