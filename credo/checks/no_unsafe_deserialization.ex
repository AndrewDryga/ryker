      Security: never deserialize or evaluate untrusted input. Ryker ingests
      bytes from workers, webhooks and models, so the External Term Format is not an input
      format here — decode with `Jason` and rebuild the term from values you
      whitelist.

          # ❌ — all three decode attacker bytes into a term
          :erlang.binary_to_term(cursor)
          :erlang.binary_to_term(cursor, [:safe])
          Plug.Crypto.non_executable_binary_to_term(cursor, [:safe])

          # ✅ — bound the bytes, then decode into typed values
          with {:ok, json} <- Base.url_decode64(cursor, padding: false),
               true <- byte_size(json) <= @max_decoded_cursor_bytes,
               {:ok, [direction, values]} <- Jason.decode(json) do

      `:safe` is not a size bound, and neither is the non-executable filter.
      Both constrain which terms may be BUILT — no new atoms, no funs — not how
      large they may be. ETF carries zlib-compressed payloads that
      `binary_to_term` inflates transparently, so a few hundred bytes on the
      wire become an arbitrarily larger term. `non_executable_binary_to_term/2`
      is no better: it decodes in full and only then walks the result rejecting
      funs, so the allocation has already happened by the time it can object.
      That is CVE-2026-69659 (Ash keyset cursors) — a list of repeated small
      integers amplified several orders of magnitude, rejected for its shape
      only after it had been allocated.

      Where ETF is genuinely unavoidable, a documented
      `# credo:disable-for-next-line Ryker.Checks.NoUnsafeDeserialization`
      under its why-comment needs BOTH guards before the decode; neither alone
      is sufficient, and no AST check can see that they are actually there:

        1. Refuse compression. A compressed payload starts
           `<<131, 80, uncompressed_size::32, _::binary>>`, so match
           `<<131, 80, _::binary>>` and reject — viable wherever our own encoder
           does not compress, which covers every round-trip design we have.
           (Bounding against that declared size is the alternative: the runtime
           enforces the declaration during decode, so a payload that misreports
           it fails, which makes it trustworthy as a filter.)
        2. Bound the raw byte size. An uncompressed payload declares nothing and
           still allocates in proportion to its length, so the compression check
           alone leaves the cheaper attack wide open.

      `Ryker.ControlPlane.TranscriptCursor` is the worked example of the
      preferred shape: a JSON envelope, an encoded-size guard on the decode
      function head before any Base64 decode, and bounded values checked after
      `Jason.decode`.

      `Code.eval_string` / `eval_quoted` / `eval_file` evaluate code at runtime —
      never on any value that can carry input.

      Complements `UnsafeToAtom` (IL-14) and `NoProcessDictionary`.
